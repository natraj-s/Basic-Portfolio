                    Born in India, I split my time growing up between Dubai, India, and finally the US. I was introduced to the PC in my 
                    4th grade, but it wasn't until my uncle bought the first PC in my family sometime in '97 that I had fulltime access to
                    it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As any other kid introduced to his/her first PC, I was fascinated by it immediately. I was inspired to explore it further
                    than my previous usage sessions in school which only involved some brief coding with BASIC. So obviously, I gravitated
                    towards the numerous games included with my first PC, while simultaneously expressing my creative side through MS Paint.
                    Upon the coercion of my parents, I ended up taking my first HTML course during one of my summers in between school years.</p>
                <p>
                    After moving to the US however, this love for video games was further enforced as I got introduced to other game consoles. The freedom
                    available in games like Grand Theft Auto 3 and the underlying creativity in the gameplay of games like Hitman eventually led 
                    me to majoring in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While working on projects during my undergrad and on projects as part of work post-graduation, one thing became
                    immensely clear to me: I enjoyed working on the look and feel of things just as much as the technical underlyings of it. During 
                    my childhood, I used to spend my waking hours drawing and while, I may no longer be interested in pure art like I was, I never lost
                    that creative itch. I just applied that creative side to other ventures. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, that love for meddling with both the technical and creative side of things has essentially brought me back full circle
                    to where it all began: web development. I fully understand that at some point, I'll have to choose which side of things I really
                    want to focus on and grown in. Until then, I'll continue to try and grow in both as much as possible.
